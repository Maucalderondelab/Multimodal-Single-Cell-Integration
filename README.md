# Multimodal-Single-Cell-Integration

This was my first competition as a Data Scientis, I've enjoyded very much this experience even though I finish just below the 50% I fell extremly gratefull and more motivated tahn ever. 
This was a competition hosted by Kaggle with the name [Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Integration](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal). 

## The goal of the competition

The goal of this competition is to predict how DNA, RNA and protein measurments co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stems cell develop into more mature blood cells. I developed a model trained on a subser of 300,000 cwll time course dataser of CD34+ hematopoitic stem and progenitos cells from human donors at five points generated gor the comptetition by Cellaty.


## Understanding the competition

To understad the goal of the competition we hace to know what is DNA, RNA and a protein

* *DNA* Deoxyribonucleic acid is the molecule that carries genetic information for the develop and functioning of an organism. The DNA is made of two linked stands that wind arrounf each other to resemble a twisted ladder, this shape is known as double helix. Each strand has a back bone made of alternating sugar and phosphate grups
  Attached to each sugar is one of gour bases:
    - Adenine (A)
    - Cytosine (C)
    - Guanine (G)
    - Thymine (T)
    
  Two strands are conected by chemical bonds between the bases, as it follows

        adeninde <--- bonds ---> thymine
  
        Cytosine <--- bonds ---> guanine
  
  The sequences of the bases along DNA's backbone encodes biological information, such as the instruction for making a protein or RNA molecule
