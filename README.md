# Multimodal-Single-Cell-Integration

This was my first competition as a Data Scientis, I've enjoyded very much this experience even though I finish just below the 50% I fell extremly gratefull and more motivated tahn ever. 
This was a competition hosted by Kaggle with the name [Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Integration](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal). 

## The goal of the competition

The goal of this competition is to predict how DNA, RNA and protein measurments co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stems cell develop into more mature blood cells. I developed a model trained on a subser of 300,000 cwll time course dataser of CD34+ hematopoitic stem and progenitos cells from human donors at five points generated gor the comptetition by Cellaty.
